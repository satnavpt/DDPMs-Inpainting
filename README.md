# DDPMs-Inpainting

This is the codebase for my Part II dissertation at the University of Cambridge. It explores the use of Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models for Image Inpainting. It implements DDPMs, DDIM sampling DDPMs with learned reverse process variances, and Score-based SDEs. Models can be trained, sampled and generated by creating config files (see the configs directory). I also developed a web app that uses the diffusion model to allow users to edit images. A demo video is included in the root of the repository.
